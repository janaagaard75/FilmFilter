# Film Filter

Film Filter is a side project testing how a filtering approach could work when selecting a movie to see in the theater. The sad conclusion for now is that it doesn't work with all the possible angles a user could take when wanting to find a movie to go and see in the theater.

The interface is good for answering a question like "What options do I have if want to see the original version of Sing in 2D in one of these theaters this Friday afternoon?", but no so good if you want to see the movies that show in the theater Imperial, and pretty much unusable if you just want to browse the movies.
