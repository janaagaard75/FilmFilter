## Output

* JSON arrays.
* The ID is the position in the array.
* What about the verions of the movies? Would it make sense to put them in a separate table? It's a many-to-many relation. Introduce a relation table?
* What kind of cross references are needed? Is it enough to link a showing to a movie and a theater?
